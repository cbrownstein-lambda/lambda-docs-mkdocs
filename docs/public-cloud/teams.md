# Teams

## Create a team

1. In the dashboard, click **Team** at the bottom-left of the dashboard.
   Then, click **Invite** at the top-right of the Team dashboard.
2. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite to your team.
   Select their role in the team, either an **Admin** or a **Member**.
   Then, click **Send invitation**.

    !!! warning

        **Be sure to invite only trusted persons to your team!**

        Currently, the only differences between the _Admin_ and _Member_ roles are
        that an _Admin_ can:

        * Invite others to the team.
        * Remove others from the team.
        * Modify payment information.
        * Change the team name.

        This means that a person with a _Member_ role can, for example:

        * Launch instances that will incur charges.
        * Terminate instances that should continue to run.

    !!! note

        You can’t send an invitation to an email address already associated with
        a Lambda Cloud account. If you try to, you’ll be presented with a
        message that says there is already a Lambda Cloud account associated
        with the email address you’re trying to send an invitation to.

    The person you’re inviting to your team must first close their existing
    Lambda Cloud account before they can be invited to your team.

1. The person you invited to your team will receive an email letting them
   know that they’ve been invited to a team on Lambda Cloud. In that email,
   they should click **Join the Team**.

    !!! note

        Until the person you invited to your team accepts their invitation,
        they will be listed in the Team dashboard as **Invitation pending**.

        You can delete the invitation while it’s pending by clicking **⋮**
        where the person is listed in your Team dashboard, then choosing
        **Delete invitation**.

    !!! note

        If the person you invited to your team doesn’t receive their
        invitation, you have to delete their invitation then invite them again.

In the Team dashboard of the person you invited to your team, the person will
see that they are on your team. In your Team dashboard, you’ll see the person
you invited listed.

## Change a teammate’s role

To change the role of a person on your team from _Member_ to _Admin_,
click **⋮** where the person is listed in your Team dashboard, then
choose **Change to Admin**.

Conversely, to change the role of a person on your team from _Admin_ to
_Member_, click **⋮** where the person is listed in your Team dashboard,
then choose **Change to Member**.

## Close a teammate’s account

listed in your Team dashboard. Then, choose **Deactivate user**.
